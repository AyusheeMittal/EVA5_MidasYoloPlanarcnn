How amazing it is when a camera can make up what is infront of it, how many of it and possibly take actions accordingly just the way we do. So this assignment talks about one such revolutionary algorithm that has not only made all this possible but that too with brilliant precision - YOLO Algorithm. Yolo which stands for - You Only Look Once, is an "Object Detection" algorithm which deals with detecting instances of various classes of objects like person, cat, dog, book, tie, car, etc.
